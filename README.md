# Sign-Language-Detector.py
Overview
This project aims to build a sign language gesture detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to recognize hand gestures from images that 
represent letters from the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. The detector can classify images of sign language letters into their corresponding ASL gesture.

Features:
- Image Classification: Recognizes hand gestures as letters in the ASL alphabet.
- Data Augmentation: Uses data augmentation to improve model accuracy and generalization.
- Model Training: Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new images of sign language gestures.

Setup and Installation:
Step 1: Clone the Repository
To begin, clone this repository onto your local machine. This will give you access to all the necessary files and folders needed to run the project.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Then, install the projectâ€™s required dependencies using pip by following these steps:

Dataset:
This model is designed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) letters. You can use an existing ASL dataset, such as the Sign Language MNIST dataset or the Kaggle ASL Alphabet dataset.

The dataset should be organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a specific sign language gesture (e.g., a letter of the alphabet). For example:

train/ (training data)

A/ (folder containing images of the 'A' sign)
B/ (folder containing images of the 'B' sign)
...
test/ (testing data)

A/
B/
...
